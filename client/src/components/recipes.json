Times may vary depending on how hot your oven gets.Remove the potatoes from the oven and let stand at room temperature until they are cool enough to handle, about 20-30 minutes.

Continue to cook the butter, stirring frequently, until brown bits begin to form on the bottom of the pan, about 5-6 minutes. Pay close attention as the butter can quickly go from brown to burnt in a matter of seconds. Once you see the brown bits forming and a nutty aroma fills the air, pull the butter from the heat immediately. Set aside.Cut the tops off of the sweet potatoes, lengthwise. Scoop the sweet potato flesh into a medium bowl, leaving the skins in tact. To the bowl, add the brown butter, 2 tablespoons of the fresh parsley, 3/4 of the chopped bacon, and 4 ounces of the goats cheese. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper to taste and mash the ingredients together until combined. Scoop the filling back into the sweet potatoes.Place the potatoes on a baking sheet that has been lined with foil or parchment paper. Place them back in the oven to bake for 25 minutes.While your potatoes are baking for a second time, prepare your avocado cream. In the bowl of your food processor or blender, combine the avocados, sour cream and buttermilk. Add a dash of salt and pepper and pulse until completely smooth and creamy.Once your potatoes have baked, remove from oven. Sprinkle on the remaining parsley, bacon and goats cheese.

It is important to get the oil nice and hot (not smoking, just before that point) your shrimp should sizzle when added to the pan. Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long. Squeeze over the lime juice  this too should bubble and reduce. Add a little salt and pepper, stir through, remove from the heat and set aside.\n2.Mix the dressing ingredients together, check for flavour, adjust if need be and set aside.\n3.Place all the salad ingredients in a bowl except the avocado and the salt and pepper. Prepare the avocado as you are about to serve otherwise it will turn brown. Once it is covered in the lime dressing, this will slow down the oxidization process and it wont go brown so easily.\n4.When you are ready to serve mix  of the avocado through the salad and add the dressing. Toss everything together. Taste to see if you need any salt and pepper. Place your shrimp on top of the salad with the rest of the avocado and sprinkle/pour any residue from the pan over your salad in which you cooked the shrimp. This is great flavour, so you dont want to lose it.","tags":["side dish","lunch","main course","salad","main dish","dinner"],"datePosted":"5/1/2021","postedBy":"Geraldine Hackett"},{"dietaryPreferences":{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"healthy":false,"cheap":false,"sustainable":false},"recipeIngredients":[{"ingredient":"salmon","amount":"4","howToPrepare":"4 salmon, fillets, (about 1 lb total)"},{"ingredient":"olive oil","amount":"2tablespoons","howToPrepare":"2 tablespoons olive oil"},{"ingredient":"lemon","amount":"1teaspoon","howToPrepare":"1 teaspoon grated lemon, rind"},{"ingredient":"juice of lemon","amount":"2","howToPrepare":"2 tablespoons lemon, juice"},{"ingredient":"fresh chives","amount":"1tablespoon","howToPrepare":"1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives or 1 tbsp chopped green onion"},{"ingredient":"dijon mustard","amount":"2teaspoons","howToPrepare":"2 teaspoons Dijon mustard"},{"ingredient":"salt","amount":"1pinch","howToPrepare":"1 pinch salt"},{"ingredient":"pepper","amount":"1pinch","howToPrepare":"1 pinch pepper"},{"ingredient":"sour cream","amount":"1cup","howToPrepare":"1 cup sour cream"},{"ingredient":"cucumber","amount":"2tablespoons","howToPrepare":"2 tablespoons finely chopped cucumber"},{"ingredient":"dill","amount":"1tablespoon","howToPrepare":"1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill or ½ tsp dried dill, weed"},{"ingredient":"fresh chives","amount":"2teaspoons","howToPrepare":"2 teaspoons minced fresh chives or 2 tsp minced green onion"}],"title":"Cedar-Planked Salmon With Mustard Dill Sauce","likes":10,"timeToCook":"45","servings":6,"img":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/637335-556x370.jpg","overview":"Cedar-Planked Salmon With Mustard Dill Sauce could be just the <b>gluten free and pescatarian</b> recipe you've been looking for.

Pour mixture into medium skillet and set over medium-low heat to warm. Add additional suero or buttermilk and stir. Taste and season with salt, usually about 2 teaspoons. If the sauce is too spicy, add  cup of crema or sour cream and stir. If the sauce is too thick, add water until desired consistency is reached.\nChicken (Optional)\nIn a pot with enough water to cover, boil chicken breasts 25 minutes or until juices run clear. Drain, cool, and shred. Optional time-saver: shred a store bought rotisserie chicken.\nStacked Style\nFry tortillas in hot oil until softened. Drain on paper towels. Soften tortillas by soaking in sauce one at a time. Place softened tortillas on individual serving plates. Layer with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Repeat process for a total of 3 tortillas for each serving.\nOven Style\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1 cup of the sauce in an ungreased 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Fry tortillas in hot oil just until softened. Drain on paper towels. Fill with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Roll, placing seam side down.\nPour 2 cups of the sauce over enchiladas. Sprinkle with crumbled queso fresco and bake until warm, about 15 minutes. Serve with a dollop of crema or sour cream and your favorite side dish.","tags":["lunch","main course","main dish","dinner"],"datePosted":"5/1/2021","postedBy":"Kelvin Langworth"},{"dietaryPreferences":{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"healthy":false,"cheap":false,"sustainable":false},"recipeIngredients":[{"ingredient":"butter","amount":"220g","howToPrepare":"220g Butter (room temperature)"},{"ingredient":"sugar","amount":"170g","howToPrepare":"170g Sugar"},{"ingredient":"eggs","amount":"210g","howToPrepare":"3 Large eggs (about 210g) - separated"},{"ingredient":"vanilla extract","amount":"1tsp","howToPrepare":"1 tsp Vanilla extract"},{"ingredient":"plain flour","amount":"180g","howToPrepare":"180g Plain flour"},{"ingredient":"corn flour","amount":"30g","howToPrepare":"30g Corn flour"},{"ingredient":"baking powder","amount":"5g","howToPrepare":"5g Baking powder"},{"ingredient":"green apple","amount":"250g","howToPrepare":"250g Green apple, peeled and cubed and mix with 1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice"},{"ingredient":"lemon zest","amount":"1large","howToPrepare":"Lemon zest from 1 large lemon"}],"title":"Apple Soft Pound Cake","likes":12,"timeToCook":"45","servings":1,"img":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/632593-556x370.jpg","overview":"Apple Soft Pound Cake is a <b>lacto ovo vegetarian</b> recipe with 1 servings.

Set the shrimp aside in cold water. In the large \"gumbo pot\" boil heads and hulls for 30 minutes to an hour. This will give you Creole gumbo. Strain shrimp heads and hulls from stock and set aside. Discard heads and hull immediately. Otherwise, the next day your kitchen will smell like Bayou St. John.\nClean the fresh crabs  If the crabs are fresh, you must take time to clean them. Discard the hard back shell and some of the so-called \"dead man,\" or yellow insides. Clean and separate crabs and set aside. (Note: If necessary, you can use meat from king, Dungeness, snow or stone crabs for your gumbo).\nBefore you fire up the stove again, cut up your celery, parsley, peppers, onions and garlic, especially if you're alone and there is no one to help you stir the pots. It takes time peeling the onions and garlic  Put the celery and parsley in a separate container from the other chopped ingredients and refrigerate until needed to keep them fresh.\nPlace the gumbo pot with the shrimp stock on the stove. Add cleaned crabs and bay leaves. Stir slowly. You don't want your shrimp stock messing up the floor. Add celery, parsley, and tomato paste to the gumbo brewing on the stove. Bring to a boil. Turn down heat, cover, and let simmer.\nHere comes the roux -- a thick and flavorful sauce that has become one of the most important staples of Louisiana cuisine. Pour oil or shortening into a separate heavy skillet (please do not use a thin omelet pan) over a medium-low heat. Slowly stir in flour to make the roux. Keep your eyes on the skillet. If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy. If black specks appear, the roux is burned. Throw it out and start from scratch. A good roux could take 30 to 45 minutes cooking time.\nNow you are ready to add the holy trinity of onions, garlic, and green peppers to the roux mixture. Stir ingredients in slowly because the flour is still sizzling. The moisture will begin to disappear. This is when Jean would add another quart or two of water to the gumbo pot. Add roux to the gumbo pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and cover. The kitchen should smell good right now. Pour yourself another cold something-or-other. You're halfway there. Come back to look and stir in an hour or so.\nSeason to taste: add salt, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and any Creole seasoning you like. Don't overdo it right now. Let the roux work its magic absorbing all the wonderful ingredients. Gumbo is usually very spicy, but you can keep it mild. Remember, if you have decided to use andouille sausage it is also hot.\nFry sausages and okra with a little bit of the leftover grease. Sprinkle a little leftover flour if the okra is fresh. Add to gumbo pot. Add chopped peeled tomatoes, stirring until well blended. Add more water if necessary. The roux will keep it thick and tasty. Return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours over low heat.\nSkim any excess fat. Add shrimp. Stir in slowly as you increase the heat one last time. It's time to stir in the fil powder. Cook another 20 to 30 minutes until the gumbo is thick. Taste and adjust seasonings one more time. Did I mention the rice? Seafood gumbo is served over Louisiana rice. Of course, you can substitute for your own favorite rice. Just plain old brown or white rice will do. Before serving, taste one more time and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat and remove seafood gumbo from the stove.\nTo cool down the pot before serving, place it in the sink with a few inches of ice-cold water. If needed, add additional salt and Tabasco sauce. If you can see through the gumbo to the bottom of the pot, work on your roux next time.","tags":["lunch","soup","main course","main dish","dinner"],"datePosted":"5/1/2021","postedBy":"Mrs. Shannon Ryan"},{"dietaryPreferences":{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"healthy":false,"cheap":false,"sustainable":false},"recipeIngredients":[{"ingredient":"oats","amount":"2cups","howToPrepare":"2 cups Quaker oats"},{"ingredient":"smooth peanut butter","amount":"0.25cup","howToPrepare":"1/4 cup smooth peanut butter"},{"ingredient":"butter","amount":"1tbsp","howToPrepare":"1 tbsp butter"},{"ingredient":"vegetable oil","amount":"2tbsp","howToPrepare":"2 tbsp vegetable oil"},{"ingredient":"whole wheat flour","amount":"1cup","howToPrepare":"1 cup whole wheat flour"},{"ingredient":"honey","amount":"2tbsp","howToPrepare":"2 tbsp honey"},{"ingredient":"brown sugar","amount":"0.3333333333333333cup","howToPrepare":"1/3 cup brown sugar"},{"ingredient":"vanilla extract","amount":"1tbsp","howToPrepare":"1 tbsp vanilla extract"},{"ingredient":"cinnamon","amount":"1tbsp","howToPrepare":"1 tbsp cinnamon"},{"ingredient":"apple","amount":"1","howToPrepare":"1 apple, peeled and diced"}],"title":"Peanut Butter and Apple Oatmeal Breakfast Bars","likes":15,"timeToCook":"45","servings":8,"img":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/655212-556x370.jpg","overview":"The recipe Peanut Butter and Apple Oatmeal Breakfast Bars can be made <b>in around roughly 45 minutes</b>.
